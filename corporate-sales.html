                    We back everything we make with our Ironclad Guarantee. If your item isn’t working for you, please follow the instructions in the section "Repairs and Quality Returns" below.

                    You are welcome to return anything that was ordered from eu.Patagonia.com—both new and sale items. Although there is no set time limit, we ask that returns for fit or color be made in a timely manner and that items be kept in new condition with tags attached.
